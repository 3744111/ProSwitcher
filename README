 by rpetrich and chpwn
 
Requires iPhone SDK 3.0+ to compile and iPhone OS 3.0+ to run
If DebMaker is installed, it will be used to make deb packages for device builds

Uses MobileSubstrate (saurik) as loader
Uses code from kirikae (ashikase) to track apps; also best used with his Backgrounder app :)
